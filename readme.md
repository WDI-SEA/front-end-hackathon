I created a website that pairs a song with a looped video to create a mood-environment. For now, the song stays the same, but the video can be changed using the arrow on the right of the page. 

This page is totally experimental and was used as a chance for me to flex my minimalist design skills. 

This page was built using HTML, CSS, BigVideo.js, and Foundation6. 

** The videos and songs are not uploaded to github. The files were too large. 

** Live site can be viewed at www.keidra.co/chill
