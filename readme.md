Chill is a website that pairs a song with a looped video to create a mood-environment. The song stays the same, but the video can be changed using the arrow on the right of the page. 


This page is totally experimental and was used as a chance for me to flex my minimalist design skills. 


TECH USED: using HTML, CSS, BigVideo.js, and Foundation6.

** The videos and songs are not uploaded to github. The files were too large. 

** Live site can be viewed at www.keidra.co/chill
